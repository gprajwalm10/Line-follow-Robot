Line Following Robot
Project Overview:
This project details the design, construction, and programming of a simple yet effective Line Following Robot. A line-following robot is an autonomous vehicle that can detect and follow a visible line (usually a black line on a white surface or vice-versa) drawn on the floor. This robot is built using common microcontroller platforms and sensors, making it an excellent beginner-friendly project for robotics enthusiasts and students.

Features:
Autonomous Navigation: Automatically follows a predefined path (line).

Infrared (IR) Sensor Array: Utilizes IR sensors for precise line detection.

Differential Drive System: Employs two independent motors for steering and movement.

Modular Design: Easy to understand, modify, and expand.

Components Used:
The following hardware components are typically used in this project:

Microcontroller Board: e.g., Arduino Uno, ESP32, or similar

IR Line Follower Sensors: e.g., TCRT5000 (3-5 sensors recommended for better accuracy)

DC Geared Motors: (2 units)

Motor Driver Module: e.g., L298N, DRV8833

Robot Chassis: (Acrylic, 3D printed, or custom-made)

Wheels: (2 units)

Battery: e.g., 9V battery, LiPo battery pack

Breadboard / Perfboard: For connections

Jumper Wires

USB Cable: For programming the microcontroller

Software & Tools Used:
Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO for ESP32)

C++ (for Arduino/ESP32 programming)

Fritzing (optional, for circuit diagrams)

Brief Wiring Description:

Connect IR sensor outputs to digital input pins on the microcontroller.

Connect motor driver input pins to digital output pins on the microcontroller.

Connect motor driver output pins to the DC motors.

Power the microcontroller, sensors, and motor driver from the battery.

How It Works:
The line-following robot operates on a simple principle:

Line Detection: The IR sensors emit infrared light and detect its reflection. A black line absorbs more light, while a white surface reflects more. By comparing the reflected light, the sensors can distinguish between the line and the background.

Microcontroller Processing: The microcontroller reads the digital (or analog) values from the IR sensors. Based on which sensors detect the line, it determines the robot's position relative to the line (e.g., centered, slightly left, far left, etc.).

Motor Control: Based on the sensor readings, the microcontroller sends signals to the motor driver.

If the robot is centered, both motors move forward at the same speed.

If the robot drifts left, the right motor speeds up, or the left motor slows down/stops, causing the robot to turn right and re-center.

If the robot drifts right, the left motor speeds up, or the right motor slows down/stops, causing the robot to turn left and re-center.

Continuous Loop: This process repeats continuously, allowing the robot to follow the line smoothly.

Installation & Setup:
To get this project up and running:

Assemble the Hardware:

Mount the motors and wheels onto the chassis.

Attach the caster wheel.

Secure the microcontroller board and motor driver.

Position the IR sensors at the front bottom of the robot, ensuring they can effectively read the line.

Wire all components according to your circuit diagram.

Software Setup:

Download and install the Arduino IDE.

Connect your microcontroller board to your computer via USB.

Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE (Tools > Board and Tools > Port).

Upload the Code:

Open the line_follower_robot.ino (or similar) file in the Arduino IDE.

Review the code, especially pin assignments, and adjust them if necessary to match your hardware setup.

Click the "Upload" button to compile and upload the code to your microcontroller.

Usage:
Prepare the Track: Create a track with a clear, dark line (e.g., black electrical tape) on a light surface (e.g., white chart paper or floor). Ensure the line width is appropriate for your sensor array.

Power On: Place the robot on the line and connect the battery to power it on.

Observe: The robot should immediately start following the line.

Troubleshooting: If the robot doesn't follow the line correctly, check:

Sensor calibration (are they detecting the line/background correctly?).

Motor direction (are they spinning the correct way for turns?).

Wiring connections.

Power supply.
