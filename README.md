Brief Wiring Description:

1.  **IR Sensor Outputs**: Connect the output pins of your IR sensors to digital input pins on your microcontroller (e.g., D2, D3, D4...).
2.  **Motor Driver Inputs**: Connect the input control pins of the motor driver module (e.g., IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 for L298N) to digital output pins on your microcontroller (e.g., D5, D6, D7, D8...).
3.  **Motor Driver Outputs**: Connect the output terminals of the motor driver (e.g., OUT1, OUT2, OUT3, OUT4) directly to your DC geared motors.
4.  **Power Connections**: Ensure the microcontroller, IR sensors, and motor driver are correctly powered from your battery, paying attention to common ground connections.

🧠 How It Works
The line-following robot operates on a straightforward yet effective principle:

Line Detection: The IR sensors continuously emit infrared light. When this light hits a surface, it reflects back to the sensor's receiver. A black line absorbs most of the light, resulting in little reflection, while a white surface reflects a significant amount. By comparing the reflected light intensity, the sensors effectively distinguish between the line and the background.

Microcontroller Processing: The microcontroller constantly reads the digital (or analog) values from each IR sensor. Based on which sensors detect the line, it precisely determines the robot's current position relative to the line (e.g., perfectly centered, slightly drifted to the left, significantly off to the right, etc.).

Motor Control: Utilizing the sensor readings, the microcontroller sends appropriate signals to the motor driver, which in turn controls the speed and direction of each DC motor:

Centered: If the robot is perfectly centered on the line, both motors move forward at the same speed, maintaining a straight path.

Drifted Left: If the robot drifts to the left, the microcontroller adjusts the motor speeds (e.g., speeds up the right motor or slows down/stops the left motor) to initiate a right turn, bringing the robot back onto the line.

Drifted Right: Conversely, if the robot drifts to the right, the microcontroller adjusts the motor speeds (e.g., speeds up the left motor or slows down/stops the right motor) to initiate a left turn, re-centering the robot.

Continuous Loop: This entire process of sensing, processing, and acting repeats continuously and rapidly, allowing the robot to smoothly and autonomously follow the line.

🚀 Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to get your Line Following Robot project up and running:

1. Assemble the Hardware
Chassis Assembly: Securely mount the DC geared motors and wheels onto your robot chassis.

Caster Wheel: Attach the caster wheel to provide balance and smooth movement.

Component Mounting: Securely fix the microcontroller board and motor driver onto the chassis.

Sensor Placement: Position the IR sensors strategically at the front bottom of the robot. Ensure they are close enough to the ground to effectively read the line and cover the line's width.

Wiring: Carefully wire all components according to your circuit diagram, double-checking all connections.

2. Software Setup
Arduino IDE Installation: If you haven't already, download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.

Connect Board: Connect your microcontroller board to your computer using a USB cable.

Select Board & Port: Open the Arduino IDE, then navigate to Tools > Board and select your specific microcontroller (e.g., "Arduino Uno"). Also, go to Tools > Port and select the correct serial port connected to your board.

3. Upload the Code
Open Sketch: Open the line_follower_robot.ino (or your specific sketch file) in the Arduino IDE.

Pin Assignments: Carefully review the code, especially the pin assignments for your IR sensors and motor driver. Adjust them if necessary to match your physical wiring.

Compile & Upload: Click the "Upload" button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE. This will compile your code and upload it to your microcontroller.

🎮 Usage
Once the hardware is assembled and the code is uploaded, you're ready to see your robot in action!

Prepare the Track: Create a clear track for your robot. Use a dark line (e.g., black electrical tape, 1-2 cm wide) on a light, contrasting surface (e.g., white chart paper, light-colored floor). Ensure the line is smooth and wide enough for your sensor array.

Power On: Place the robot directly on top of the line. Connect the battery to power up the robot.

Observe: The robot should immediately begin detecting and following the line.

Troubleshooting Tips: If the robot doesn't follow the line as expected, consider these common checks:

Sensor Calibration: Are your IR sensors correctly distinguishing between the line and the background? You might need to adjust potentiometers on the sensors or tweak threshold values in your code.

Motor Direction: Are the motors spinning in the correct direction for forward movement and turns? If a motor spins backward, swap its wires connected to the motor driver.

Wiring Connections: Double-check all jumper wire connections for looseness or incorrect placement.

Power Supply: Ensure your battery has sufficient charge and is providing stable power to all components.
